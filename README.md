# FileRepo-File-Manager
This project involves the implementation of a console-based file manager written in C++ that can be helpful to the user to perform some basic functions related to file handling.



The system enables the user to perform functions such as creating a file, accessing
it, searching it in the directory, renaming it, describing a folder and its contents
and so on.


The project includes a total of five files (4 source files and 1 header file) used
to define and implement various functions related to management and
manipulation of files and data. The programs make extensive use of vectors
and structures for carrying out the required tasks. To extend the visibility of
variables across the multiple source files, use of extern keyword has been
made.
Since structures support compile time polymorphism in C++, operator
overloading has also been implemented in different source files to redefine
the meaning of certain operators without changing them.
Finally, the main program receives input from the user via a set of cases
written within the switch case statement, each defined for a particular task or
function.
